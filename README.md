# Covid-19 Vaccination Project

The present repository contains the code of a landing page developed as the final project of the English Bootcamp, at TEAM International. Built with React and Chakra UI, this landing page employs a minimalist design and also comes with a dark-mode that users can toggle. In the site, users can see information about the status of Covid-19 vaccination in the world. The live version can be checked at [Netlify](https://vaccinationproject.netlify.app/).
